# Pandas SARS-CoV-2 Project

## Introduction & Motivation
This repository serves as a quick project created to introduce data frames and data manipulation using Pandas. In this project, we will be examining:

     1. Which state/territory had the highest numerical increase in confirmed cases over the summer months 
        (July 1st - September)?
     2. Which state/territory had the highest percentage increase in confirmed cases over the same time period?
     3. What was the 7-day average increase in cases per state (over 8 weeks, starting on June 1st)?
     4. What proportion of cases nationally had occurred in NY State at the start of each month, from 
        March 2020 - August 2020?
